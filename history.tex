\chapter{A Brief History of the Data Transport Network}
\label{history}

It all started with a casual converstaion with a colleague about a
workaround he was using in a labratory class that he was teaching. He
needed to periodicly retrie data collected by some of the lab instruments
and they were doing so with a set of scripts in which the the data
were sent as attachments in an email. He was amused at the relatively
unsophiticated approach, but it was working.

A short time later, I had to implememnt a system for the real-time
retrieval of data from the Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar in
Greenland. There were a number of data sources and the network connection
to the site was over a slow 56-kbps satellite link which often stalled,
had high latency or stopped all together. We needed a system that could
handle mulitple data streams, arbitraty data files, metadata 
--- such as location and time --- and manage the newtwork outages.
